                    <p>HTML is not a programming language; it is a markup language that defines the structure of your
                        content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different
                        parts
                        of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can
                        make a
                        word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or
                        smaller,
                        and so on. For example, take the following line of content:
                    </p>
                    <code>My cat is very grumpy</code>
                    <p>If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it
                        in
                        paragraph tags:
                    </p>
                    <code>&lt;p&gt;My cat is very grumpy&lt;/p&gt;</code>

                <article>
                    <p>Let's explore this paragraph element a bit further.</p>
                    <img src="https://media.prod.mdn.mozit.cloud/attachments/2014/11/14/9347/c07aa313dbdd667585430f4eca354dbd/grumpy-cat-small.png"
                        alt="">
                    <p>The main parts of our element are as follows:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in
                            opening
                            and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect —
                            in
                            this case where the paragraph begins.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward
                            slash
                            before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the
                            paragraph
                            ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to
                            strange results.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.
                        </li>
                        <li>The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the
                            element.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Elements can also have attributes that look like the following:</p>
                    <img src="https://media.prod.mdn.mozit.cloud/attachments/2014/11/14/9345/99516bbeb470af58b608d17bb30e53e6/grumpy-cat-attribute-small.png"
                        alt="">
                    <p>
                        Attributes contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the
                        actual
                        content. Here, class is the attribute name and editor-note is the attribute value. The class
                        attribute allows you to give the element a non-unique identifier that can be used to target it
                        (and
                        any other elements with the same class value) with style information and other things.
                        <br>
                        An attribute should always have the following:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if the element already
                            has
                            one or more attributes).</li>
                        <li>The attribute name followed by an equal sign.</li>
                        <li>The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks.</li>
                    </ol>
                </article>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="Nesting_elements">
                <header>Nesting elements</header>
                <article>
                    <p>You can put elements inside other elements too — this is called nesting. If we wanted to state
                        that
                        our cat is very grumpy, we could wrap the word "very" in a &lt;strong&gt; element, which means
                        that
                        the word is to be strongly emphasized:</p>
                    <code>&lt;p&gt;My cat is &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; grumpy.&lt;/p&gt;</code>
                    <p>You do however need to make sure that your elements are properly nested. In the example above, we
                        opened the
                        &lt;p&gt; element first, then the &lt;strong&gt; element; therefore, we have to close the
                        &lt;strong&gt; element first,
                        then the &lt;p&gt; element. The following is incorrect:</p>
                    <code>&lt;p&gt;My cat is &lt;strong&gt;very grumpy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</code>
                    <p>The elements have to open and close correctly so that they are clearly inside or outside one
                        another.
                        If they overlap as shown above, then your web browser will try to make the best guess at what
                        you
                        were trying to say, which can lead to unexpected results. So don't do it!</p>

            <section class="main-section" id="Empty_elements">
                <header>Empty elements</header>
                <article>
                    <p>Some elements have no content and are called empty elements. Take the &lt;img&gt; element that we
                        already
                        have
                        in our HTML page:</p>
                    <code>&lt;img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image"&gt;</code>
                    <p>This contains two attributes, but there is no closing &lt;/img&gt; tag and no inner content. This
                        is
                        because an
                        image element doesn't wrap content to affect it. Its purpose is to embed an image in the HTML
                        page
                        in
                        the place it appears.</p>

                    <p>That wraps up the basics of individual HTML elements, but they aren't handy on their own. Now
                        we'll
                        look at how individual elements are combined to form an entire HTML page. Let's revisit the code
                        we
                        put into our index.html example (which we first met in the Dealing with files article):</p>
                    <code>
                    &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
                    <br>
                    &lt;html&gt;
                    <br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;head&gt;
                        <br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;meta charset="utf-8&gt;
                        <br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;title&gt;My test page&lt;/title&gt;
                        <br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/head&gt;
                        <br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;body&gt;
                        <br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image"&gt;
                        <br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/body&gt;
                        <br>
                    &lt;/html&gt;
                </code>
                    <p>Here, we have the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; — doctype. It is a required preamble. In the mists of time, when HTML
                            was
                            young (around 1991/92), doctypes were meant to act as links to a set of rules that the HTML
                            page
                            had to follow to be considered good HTML, which could mean automatic error checking and
                            other
                            useful things. However these days, they don't do much and are basically just needed to make
                            sure
                            your document behaves correctly. That's all you need to know for now.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            &lt;html&gt;&lt;/html&gt; — the &lt;html&gt; element. This element wraps all the content on
                            the
                            entire page and is
                            sometimes known as the root element.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt; — the &lt;head&gt; element. This element acts as a container for
                            all
                            the stuff you want to include on the
                            HTML page that isn't the content you are showing to your page's viewers. This includes
                            things like keywords and a page description that you want to appear in search results, CSS
                            to style our content, character set declarations, and more.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            &lt;meta charset="utf-8&gt; — This element sets the character set your document should use
                            to
                            UTF-8
                            which includes most characters from the vast majority of written languages. Essentially, it
                            can
                            now handle any textual content you might put on it. There is no reason not to set this and
                            it
                            can help avoid some problems later on.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt; — the &lt;title&gt; element. This sets the title of your page,
                            which
                            is the title that
                            appears in the browser tab the page is loaded in. It is also used to describe the page when
                            you bookmark/favorite it.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            &lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt; — the &lt;body&gt; element. This contains all the content that you
                            want to show to web users when they visit
                            your page, whether that's text, images, videos, games, playable audio tracks, or whatever
                            else.
                        </li>
